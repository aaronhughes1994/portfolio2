            <h2>What is the HSE?</h2>

         <h4>The Health Service Executive (HSE) is in charge of the arrangement of 
            wellbeing and individual
            social administrations for everybody living in Ireland, with open assets. 
            The Executive was set up by the Health Act, 2004 and came into official 
            operation on 1 January 2005.
            It replaces the ten provincial Health Boards, the Eastern Regional Health
            Authority and various other
            distinctive offices and associations. The Minister for Health has general
            duty regarding the Executive
            in Government. The HSE is Ireland's biggest boss with more than 67,000 
            direct representatives, and
            another 40,000 in subsidized social insurance associations. It has a yearly
            spending plan of over
            â‚¬13 billion, more than some other open part association. In March 2017 it 
            was declared that the HSE
            would be rejected and the nation would come back to the past framework now
            marked as Hospital Groups 
            and Community Health Organizations.
